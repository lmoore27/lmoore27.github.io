        <p>The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that is defined by a simple iterative algorithm. It is a set of complex numbers for which the iterative sequence remains 
          bounded and does not escape to infinity. The resulting image of the Mandelbrot set is a picture of stunning complexity and beauty, featuring repeating patterns and 
          intricate shapes. By exploring the Mandelbrot set, one can discover many different types of fractals and other complex structures. The set has applications in fields
          such as computer graphics, chaos theory, and mathematical physics. It is widely considered one of the most beautiful objects in mathematics.</p>

      <div class="julia">

        <p>The Julia set is a complex mathematical object that is often depicted graphically. It is a set of points that, when iterated through a certain mathematical formula,
           remain bounded and do not escape to infinity. The resulting image is a fractal, with intricate and repeating patterns. Different parameter values in the formula result
            in different shapes of the Julia set, ranging from smooth, connected shapes to chaotic, fragmented ones. The Julia set has applications in various fields, including 
            image compression and chaos theory, and is a subject of mathematical and artistic interest.</p>

      <div class="lissajous">
        <img src="../images/lissajous_project.png" alt="">
        <p>A Lissajous table is a type of scientific apparatus used to visualize the mathematical concept of Lissajous figures. Lissajous figures are curves that are created
           by the superposition of two simple harmonic motions. The Lissajous table typically consists of two perpendicular metal rods that can oscillate in different directions
            and at different frequencies. A pen attached to the intersection of the rods traces the resulting Lissajous figure on a piece of paper. The resulting shapes are often
             visually striking and can provide insight into the relationship between different frequencies and phase shifts. Lissajous tables are used in physics, engineering, and
              music to study vibrations and wave patterns.</p>
